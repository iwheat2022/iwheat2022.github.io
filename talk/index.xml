      <title>It is time for wheat harvest</title>
      <link>/talk/news_6/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/talk/news_6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main Content:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On June 9, 2022, the research group began to harvest wheat materials, and all students participated in this labor practice education. In the scientific research experimental site, the students carried out the harvest and seed retention in an orderly manner. The students cooperated with each other, carefully compared one plant by one, cut off the wheat spikes, loaded into marked paper bags, and transferred to the warehouse.&lt;br/&gt;
After the preliminary investigation of agronomic traits of these wheat populations in the early stage, students would mark the lines with potential high yield, and harvest all or a single spike of the descendants of this line. In the later stage, the length of spikes, grain number per spikes and 1000 grain weight of different wheat cultivars (lines) will be comprehensively evaluated, and the harvested spikes would be sown in autumn.&lt;br/&gt;
Pengcheng Wang, a second year graduate student, said in the labor practice: &amp;ldquo;every link of scientific research experiment can not be careless, I deeply realize the hardships of agricultural scientific research workers is not easy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;My participation in labor harvest makes me understand that every achievement requires perseverance and efforts.&amp;rdquo; said Yuanfei Zhang, a first-year postgraduate student who participated in the wheat harvest activity for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

On March 5, 2022, the second postgraduate academic forum was held at the International Exchange Center by the Graduate School, the Graduate Work Department of the Party Committee, the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Agriculture on the Loess Plateau and the State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Regions. Room 104 went smoothly.&lt;br/&gt;
Hao Feng, director of the Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, presided over the opening ceremony, and Zhang Chaoyang, executive deputy director of the Dry Farming Department, introduced the preparation and selection methods for the forum. Afterwards, 16 postgraduates who stood out after screening at various levels in the previous stage reported on their research topics.&lt;br/&gt;
Xiaolong Guo, a doctoral student in the research group, participated in this forum. With the theme of &amp;ldquo;Gene Function Analysis Reveals How Natural Mutations of TaGSK3 Gene Are Selected by Environment&amp;rdquo;, he introduced the gene function of natural mutants of TaGSK3 gene in simple terms, and proposed the natural mutation of TaGSK3 gene. A conjecture chosen by the environment. The whole report was eloquent and interesting, which aroused heated discussions between the judges and the audience.&lt;br/&gt;
In the end, Xiaolong Guo won the second prize of the second postgraduate academic forum of the two state key laboratories after the evaluation, discussion and selection of the expert group. This award shows Guo Xiaolong&amp;rsquo;s solid scientific research foundation and meticulous logical thinking, as well as the pragmatic and meticulous demeanor of the graduate students of the research group.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expert Profile:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Yanli Feng, female, senior agronomist, is currently the deputy head of the Yaozhou District People&amp;rsquo;s Government of Tongchuan City and the deputy chairman
of the Tongchuan Municipal Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association. Since 1991, he has been engaged in wheat breeding and technology
promotion in the front line of agricultural production. He participated in the breeding of &amp;lsquo;Tongmai No. 1-3&amp;rsquo; series of dryland wheat varieties, and presided
over the breeding of &amp;lsquo;Tongmai No. 4-6&amp;rsquo; series of dryland wheat varieties. He has presided over and participated in 24 provincial and municipal scientific
research and technology promotion projects, of which four won the Municipal Science and Technology Progress Award issued by the municipal government, and five
won the Provincial Science and Technology Promotion and Progress Award issued by the provincial government, and were rated as outstanding in Tongchuan City.
Contributed top-notch talents and winner of the &amp;ldquo;May 4th&amp;rdquo; Youth Medal in Shaanxi Province.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;forum:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On February 25, 2022, Yanli Feng, a breeder of the dryland wheat variety &amp;lsquo;Tongmai&amp;rsquo; series, came to the research group to have a discussion and exchange
on how graduate students should choose jobs and find employment. All graduate students in the laboratory participated in the discussion.&lt;br/&gt;
At the symposium, Feng Yanli carefully shared her study and work experience, and provided three valuable experiences to the students: First,
always cherish the thirst for knowledge, maintain a progressive heart, be full of thirst for knowledge, and constantly motivate yourself 2.
We must do well the seemingly complicated, subtle and ordinary daily work, exercise our confidence and patience with priorities, work hard for
a long time in the process of thinking, exploration, and summarization, improve day by day, and strive for early accumulation. Think, improve
emotional intelligence, if you want to win the respect of others, you must first know how to respect others. If you want to be warm and kind,
you must first learn to treat people with sincerity.&lt;br/&gt;
Afterwards, the students had a more in-depth exchange with Feng Yanli about their career and employment confusion. There were heated discussions
around &amp;lsquo;how to choose a work direction&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;how to choose a work place&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;how to define a job as a career to pursue in a lifetime&amp;rsquo;. Ma Xiuyun,
a 2019 graduate student, said happily: &amp;lsquo;The communication with Mr. Feng was like a timely spring rain, which blew away the &amp;lsquo;smog&amp;rsquo; I faced in
choosing a career. Now I am more clear about what career choice I should make.&amp;rsquo; Sun Shuyang, a graduate student, said: &amp;lsquo;Thanks to Mr. Feng for
his valuable advice on employment issues, which allowed me to determine the goals of my postgraduate studies and provide direction for my future
study and work.&lt;/p&gt;
